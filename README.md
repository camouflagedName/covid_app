Mobile app to upload pictures of Covid vax card, recent covid test, and photo ID


Client facing mobile app that allows user to upload. First foray into Native programming. Built using Expo/React Native.

In Progress: 
- creating a "backend" using asyncstorage as a dependency to allow persistent state of any add pictures
- a settings modal that will allow users to update preferences including: color changes, username
